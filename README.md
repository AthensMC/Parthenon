An app for managing servers.

The goal for this app is to make managing Minecraft servers reliably and easily come together
Planning on the ability to send commands to a server, check its status, make backups and spin up new servers easily.

Like the ability to have a Event server be spun up within minutes.

Heavily inspired by [Gamocosm](https://github.com/Gamocosm/Gamocosm).

There's a lot of moving parts to connect and seeing how Gamocosm handled it was a fascinating experience. Gave a ton of inspiration, but ultimately we determined that because we use our own infrastructure it wasn't suitable for our needs.
